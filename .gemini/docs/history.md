- **Phase 1.2 Accomplishments:**
    - **Documentation Hub:** Implemented `@sous/docs` with a persistent Knowledge Base that aggregates ADRs, Specs, and READMEs. Refactored `@sous/features` build system to support split client/server entries for Next.js compatibility.
    - **CLI DDD Refactoring:** Reorganized `@sous/cli` into strategic umbrellas (`dev`, `env`, `quality`, `maintenance`).
    - **Robust Dev Orchestrator:** Implemented an interactive React Ink TUI for `sous dev`, replacing static logging with a real-time process dashboard.
