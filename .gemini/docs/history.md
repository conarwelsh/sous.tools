# History

## 2026-02-04
- Refactored `scripts/dev-orchestrator.ts` to use absolute `pnpm` paths and avoid `shell: true` issues, fixing `ENOENT` errors during app startup.
- Fixed Zellij `dev.kdl` to properly show the tab bar and ensure all service logs are piped to the "God View".
- Updated root `.idea` configuration to use `#GRADLE_LOCAL_JAVA_HOME` for better WSL compatibility in Android Studio.
- Switched to `includeBuild` in the root `settings.gradle.kts` for Tauri-based projects.
- Fixed a Gradle sync error in the `apps/native` subproject by removing the redundant `allprojects` repository block.
- Fixed Android Studio "Invalid Gradle JDK" warnings by switching to `#PROJECT_SDK` and defining a clean `17` JavaSDK in `.idea/misc.xml`.
- Configured monorepo for "Single Window" Android Studio support by adding root `settings.gradle.kts` and `build.gradle.kts`.
- Updated `dev-device-installation.md` with physical device setup and monorepo IDE instructions.
- Fixed `@sous/config` package by implementing a proper build step with `tsup`. This resolved a `SyntaxError: Named export 'localConfig' not found` in Vite.
- Improved `scripts/install-dev.sh` to support ZSH, use correct Android SDK paths, and export `TAURI_DEV_HOST`.
- Fixed missing `unzip` dependency and added automatic ARM64 `apt` source fixing in `scripts/install-dev.sh`.
- Verified `@sous/docs` and `@sous/web` functionality.
- Configured development environment with non-conflicting ports:
  - API: 4000
  - Web: 3000
  - Docs: 3001
  - Native Apps (Vite): 1421-1424
- Fixed `@sous/native*` application identifiers in `tauri.conf.json` to avoid reserved keywords (e.g., changed `com.conar.native` to `com.sous.nativeapp`).

    - Refined ADR 022: Defined the two-tier layout system (Structural Templates vs. Specialized Content Assignment).
    - **Final Strategic Refinements:**
        - Differentiated **Intelligence** (Real-time) vs. **Accounting** (Historical) domains.

- **Phase Rollout Plan Realignment:**
    - Prioritized "Phase 1.5: Production Readiness" to ensure all native apps build/deploy successfully.
