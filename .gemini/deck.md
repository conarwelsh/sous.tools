# Sous OS: Operating System for the Physical World
## Partner Pitch Deck - Q1 2026

---

# The Problem
### Fragmentation in the Kitchen

- **Disconnected Systems:** POS doesn't talk to Inventory. Inventory doesn't talk to Recipes.
- **Hardware Chaos:** iPads, Printers, and Kiosks running different OS versions.
- **Data Silos:** Owners have no real-time visibility into COGS or wastage.

**The Result:** 5-10% of revenue lost to inefficiency.

# The Solution
### Sous OS (v0.1.0)

A unified, web-first platform that connects every screen in the building.

- **One Codebase:** Runs on Cloud, Mobile, and Edge hardware.
- **Local-First:** Keeps running even when the internet goes down.
- **AI-Powered:** Automates data entry from Invoices and Recipes.
